Introduction
============

The first change in the data and metadata message is one of terminology.
In order to foster consistency in the standard, the names and namespaces
of the data and metadata message have been changed. The namespaces now
have a uniform format of /data/format and /metadata/format, where format
is either generic or structured (i.e. the structure specific formats).
This also applies to the message names as well, where the names follow
the pattern of FormatData (e.g. StructuredData and GenericMetadata).

The various data messages which existed in the standard have been
harmonised into two general formats; generic and structured data. The
generic data is much like it has been previously, only slightly modified
to conform with the harmonised view on data. The structured data
combined the principles of the previous versions compact and cross
sectional formats into one more generalised format.

The major shift from the previous version is now that all data can be
exchanged as either an un-grouped collection of observations, each
specifying a full key or it can be exchanged as data grouped into series
with any single dimension placed at the observation level. This in
effect, combined the abilities of the time series and cross sectional
formats in the a single data format. This format also allows for
multiple measure to be expressed when the observation dimension is the
measure dimension defined in the data structured. The key differences
from the previous versions is that this all is possible in a single data
structure definition specific format, as well as being possible in the
generic format as well. The goal was to make the structures as
homogenous as possible.

Another shift from the previous version in the manner in which the base
data structure specific format is defined. In previous versions there
was not structure defined, so one had to understand all of the
requirements and read the specification in order to understand what
could be expected in any structure specific format. In this version,
that issue has been addressed. The base structures now impose a strict
format on the data structure specific schemas. This is achieved much
like the referencing structure in the common namespace through the use
of unqualified elements. By the elements not existing in a namespace,
the structure specific schemas can place the necessary restrictions of
them while still being forced to adhere to prescribed structure. This
means that not only are the structures able to perform the validation
that is required, but that the messages will be much simpler to process
as the format will always use the same element names.

Finally, in order to allow for systems which wish to not process the new
more flexible data format, time series only variations of both the
generic and structured data sets exist. It is important to note that
these structures are derived via restriction from the more generalised
format. This means that a data set in the general format with the time
dimension at the observation level will have exactly the same content as
a time series only data set. The result of this is that there is no
additional burden for processing the time series specific format it a
system can process the more generalised format. These time series only
data sets allow for time series only data messages to exist. These
messages make it simple for system which, in the previous version of the
standard, only used the time series formats to continue to do so.

These same principles have been applied to the reference data messages
as well. In the previous version of the standard there were major
differences between the generic and metadata structure-specific formats;
some of the differences caused some metadata sets were incompatible
between versions. In this version the structures of the generic and
metadata structure specific formats have been harmonised to the point
where they are nearly identical. Yet, the structured format still
provides the strong validation against the metadata structure that is
intended. And, as with the data, the base metadata structure specific
format now imposes a stricter structure on the generated schemas, making
the structure specific instance simpler to process in a generic manner.

**DataSetType: **\ DataSetType defines the structure of the generic data
set. Data is organised into either a collection of series (grouped
observations) or a collection of un-grouped observations. The
organisation used is dependent on the structure specification in the
header of the data message (which is referenced via the structureRef
attribute). The structure specification states which data occurs at the
observation level. If this dimension is "AllDimensions" then the data
set must consist of a collection of un-grouped observations; otherwise
the data set will contain a collection of series with the observations
in the series disambiguated by the specified dimension at the
observation level. This data set is capable of containing data (observed
values) and/or documentation (attribute values). It is assumed that each
series or un-grouped observation will be distinct in its purpose. For
example, if series contains both data and documentation, it assumed that
each series will have a unique key. If the series contains only data or
only documentation, then it is possible that another series with the
same key might exist, but with not with the same purpose (i.e. to
provide data or documentation) as the first series.

DataProvider    com: DataProviderReferenc eType DataProvider contains a reference to the provider for the data set.
Attributes      ValuesType                      Attributes contains the collection of attribute values for attributes defined in the data structure definition which do not have an attribute relationship with any other data structure definition components.
Group           GroupType                       Group contains a references to a defined group in the data structure definition along with its key (if necessary) and values for the attributes which are associated with the group. An attribute is associated to a group by either an explicit group relationship or by a group attachment when the attribute has a relationship with a dimension which is a member of this group.
Series          SeriesType                      Series contains a collection of observations that share a common key (set of dimension values). The key of a series is every dimension defined in the data structure definition, save the dimension which is declared in the structure specification to be at the observation level. In addition to the key and observations, the series contains values for attributes which have a relationship with any dimension that is part of the series key, so long as the attribute does not specify an attachment group or also has a relationship with the dimension declared to be at the observation level.
Obs             ObsOnlyType                     Obs is an un-grouped observation. This observation has a key which is a set of values for all dimensions declared in the data structure definition. In addition to the key, the value of the observation can be provided along with values for all attributes which have an association with the primary measure or any dimension (so long as it does not specify a group attachment).

**GroupType: **\ GroupType defines a structure which is used to
communicate attribute values for a group defined in a data structure
definition. The group can consist of either a subset of the dimensions
defined by the data structure definition, or an association to an
attachment constraint, which in turn defines key sets to which
attributes can be attached. In the case that the group is based on an
attachment constraint, only the identification of group is provided. It
is expected that a system which is processing this will relate that
identifier to the key sets defined in the constraint and apply the
values provided for the attributes appropriately.

**SeriesType: **\ SeriesType defines a structure which is used to group
a collection of observations which have a key in common. The key for a
series is every dimension defined in the data structure definition, save
the dimension declared to be at the observation level for this data set.
In addition to observations, values can be provided for attributes which
are associated with the dimensions which make up this series key (so
long as the attributes do not specify a group attachment or also have an
relationship with the observation dimension). It is possible for the
series to contain only observations or only attribute values, or both.

Attributes      ValuesType          Attributes contains the values for attributes which are associated with the dimensions which make up the series key, so long as the attributes do not also specify an attachment group or have a relationship with the observation dimension.
Obs             ObsType             Obs contains an observation which shares the dimensionality of the series key. These observations are disambiguated from one another within this series by a single dimension value provided for each dimension. The dimension which provides this observation key is declared in the structure specification for the data set, which is provided in the header of the data message.

full set of values for every dimension declared in the data structure
definition. The observation can contain an observed value and/or a
collection of attribute values.

ObsDimension    BaseValueType       ObsDimension holds the key for the grouped observation, i.e. the value of the observation dimension. Note that in this element, the reference to the dimension is optional, since it can be inferred from the structure specification for the data set. This saves having to repeat the value unnecessarily. It is assumed that any application processing the data set will have the information from the structure specification available, so that if a dimension identifier is not supplied here, the proper reference can be applied.

**TimeSeriesDataSetType: **\ TimeSeriesDataSetType is a derivation of
the base DataSetType of the generic format the restricts the data set to
only allow for grouped observations where the dimension at the
observation level is the time dimension of the data structure
definition. This means that unlike the base data set structure, there
can be no un-grouped observations. Because this derivation is achieved
using restriction, data sets conforming to this type will inherently
conform to the base data set structure as well. In fact, data structured
here will be identical to data in the base data set when the time
dimension is the observation dimension. This means that the data
contained in this structure can be processed in exactly the same manner
as the base structure.

**TimeSeriesType: **\ TimeSeriesType defines a structure which is used
to group a collection of observations which have a key in common,

observations, values can be provided for attributes which are associated
with the dimensions which make up this series key (so long as the
attributes do not specify a group attachment or also have an
relationship with the time dimension). It is possible for the series to

Complex Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**DataSetType: **\ DataSetType is the abstract type which defines the
base structure for any data structure definition specific data set. A
derived data set type will be created that is specific to a data
structure definition and the details of the organisation of the data
(i.e. which dimension is the observation dimension and whether explicit
measures should be used). Data is organised into either a collection of
series (grouped observations) or a collection of un-grouped
observations. The derived data set type will restrict this choice to be
either grouped or un-grouped observations. If this dimension is
"AllDimensions" then the derived data set type must consist of a
collection of un-grouped observations; otherwise the data set will
contain a collection of series with the observations in the series
disambiguated by the specified dimension at the observation level. This
data set is capable of containing data (observed values) and/or
documentation (attribute values) and can be used for incremental updates
and deletions (i.e. only the relevant updates or deletes are exchanged).
It is assumed that each series or un-grouped observation will be
distinct in its purpose. For example, if series contains both data and
documentation, it assumed that each series will have a unique key. If
the series contains only data or only documentation, then it is possible
that another series with the same key might exist, but with not with the
same purpose (i.e. to provide data or documentation) as the first
series. This base type is designed such that derived types can be
processed in a generic manner; it assures that data structure definition
specific data will have a consistent structure. The group, series, and
observation elements are unqualified, meaning that they are not
qualified with a namespace in an instance. This means that in the
derived data set types, the elements will always be the same, regardless
of the target namespace of the schemas which defines these derived
types. This allows for consistent processing of the structure without
regard to what the namespace might be for the data structure definition
specific schema. The data set can contain values for attributes which do
not have an attribute relationship with any data structure definition
components. These attribute values will exist in XML attributes in this
element based on this type (DataSet). This is specified in the content
model with the declaration of anyAttributes in the "local" namespace.
The derived data set type will refine this structure so that the
attributes are explicit. The XML attributes will be given a name based
on the attribute's identifier. These XML attributes will be unqualified
(meaning they do not have a namespace associated with them). To allow
for generic processing, it is required that the only unqualified XML
attributes in the derived data set type (outside of the standard data
set attributes) be for attributes declared in the data structure
definition. If additional attributes are required, these should be
qualified with a namespace so that a generic application can easily
distinguish them as not being meant to represent a data structure
definition attribute.

structureRef             xs:IDREF                          The structureRef contains a reference to a structural specification in the header of a data or reference metadata message. The structural specification details which structure the data or reference metadata conforms to, as well as providing additional information such as how the data is structure (e.g. which dimension occurs at the observation level for a data set).

publicationYear          xs:gYear                          The publicationYear holds the ISO 8601 four-digit year.
publicationPeriod        com: ObservationalTimePer iodType The publicationPeriod specifies the period of publication of the data or metadata in terms of whatever provisioning agreements might be in force (i.e., "Q1 2005" if that is the time of publication for a data set published on a quarterly basis).
dataScope                DataScopeType                     The dataScope attribute indicates the scope at which the data is meant to be validated. These scopes are hierarchical and are (from the top down); DataStructure, ConstrainedDataStructure, Dataflow, and ProvisionAgreement. the hierarchy of these scopes represent the cascading level of constraints, which can restrict the valid values for components. For example, a data structure defines a dimension with a coded representation. A data flow might have a constraint associated with it which further restricts the values allowed from the referenced code list to a subset of the values allowed by the data structure definition. A provision agreement that is based on the dataflow might also have a constraint, which further restricts the subset of the codelist from the dataflow. Therefore, the allowed content becomes stricter lower in the hierarchy. Data that is given a scope of one value is stated to be valid at that level and all levels below it. Therefore, this scope serves to state that data that is meant to be structured simply against the data structure definition is not meant to be validated against the a dataflow, where constraints might be applied.
REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY xs:gMonthDay                      The REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY attribute is an explict attribute for the reporting year start day, which provides context to the time dimension when its value contains a reporting period (e.g. 2010-Q1). This attribute is used to state the month and day that the reporting year begins (e.g. --07-01 for July 1st). In the absence of an explicit value provided in this attribute, all reporting period values will be assumed to be based on a reporting year start day of January 1. This is declared in the base schema since it has a fixed identifier and representation. The derived data set type may either require or prohibit this attribute, depending on whether the data structure declared the reporting year start day attribute and if so, the attribute relationship and assignment status assigned to it.

**GroupType: **\ GroupType is the abstract type which defines a
structure which is used to communicate attribute values for a group
defined in a data structure definition. The group can consist of either
a subset of the dimensions defined by the data structure definition, or
an association to an attachment constraint, which in turn defines key
sets to which attributes can be attached. In the case that the group is
based on an attachment constraint, only the identification of group is
provided. It is expected that a system which is processing this will
relate that identifier to the key sets defined in the constraint and
apply the values provided for the attributes appropriately. Data
structure definition schemas will drive types based on this for each
group defined in the data structure definition. Both the dimension
values which make up the key (if applicable) and the attribute values
associated with the group will be represented with XML attributes. This
is specified in the content model with the declaration of anyAttributes
in the "local" namespace. The derived group type will refine this
structure so that the attributes are explicit. The XML attributes will
be given a name based on the attribute's identifier. These XML
attributes will be unqualified (meaning they do not have a namespace
associated with them). The dimension XML attributes will be required
while the attribute XML attributes will be optional. To allow for
generic processing, it is required that the only unqualified XML
attributes in the derived group type be for the group dimensions and
attributes declared in the data structure definition. If additional
attributes are required, these should be qualified with a namespace so
that a generic application can easily distinguish them as not being
meant to represent a data structure definition dimension or attribute.

Obs             *ObsType*          
=============== =================== ==================================================================================================================================================================================

**ObsType: **\ ObsType is the abstract type which defines the structure
of a grouped or un-grouped observation. The observation must be provided
a key, which is either a value for the dimension which is declared to be
at the observation level if the observation is grouped, or a full set of
values for all dimensions in the data structure definition if the
observation is un-grouped. This key should disambiguate the observation
within the context in which it is defined (e.g. there should not be
another observation with the same dimension value in a series). The
observation can contain an observed value and/or attribute values. Data
structure definition schemas will drive a type or types based on this
that is specific to the data structure definition and the variation of
the format being expressed in the schema. The dimension value(s) which
make up the key and the attribute values associated with the key
dimension(s) or the primary measure will be represented with XML
attributes. This is specified in the content model with the declaration
of anyAttributes in the "local" namespace. The derived observation type
will refine this structure so that the attributes are explicit. The XML
attributes will be given a name based on the attribute's identifier.
These XML attributes will be unqualified (meaning they do not have a
namespace associated with them). The dimension XML attribute(s) will be
required while the attribute XML attributes will be optional. To allow
for generic processing, it is required that the only unqualified XML
attributes in the derived observation type be for the observation
dimension(s) and attributes declared in the data structure definition.
If additional attributes are required, these should be qualified with a
namespace so that a generic application can easily distinguish them as
not being meant to represent a data structure definition dimension or
attribute. If the data structure definition specific schema requires
that explicit measures be used (only possible when the measure dimension
is specified at the observation), then there will be types derived for
each measure defined by the measure dimension. In this case, the types
will be specific to each measure, which is to say that the
representation of the primary measure (i.e. the observed value) will be
restricted to that which is specified by the specific measure.

**TimeSeriesDataSetType: **\ TimeSeriesDataSetType is the abstract type
which defines the base structure for any data structure definition
specific time series based data set. A derived data set type will be
created that is specific to a data structure definition. Unlike the base
format, only one variation of this is allowed for a data structure
definition. This variation is the time dimension as the observation
dimension. Data is organised into a collection of time series. Because
this derivation is achieved using restriction, data sets conforming to
this type will inherently conform to the base data set structure as
well. In fact, data structure specific here will be identical to data in
the base data set when the time dimension is the observation dimension,
even for the derived data set types. This means that the data contained
in this structure can be processed in exactly the same manner as the
base structure. The same rules for derivation as the base data set type
apply to this specialized data set.

dataScope                DataScopeType                     The dataScope attribute indicates the scope at which the data is meant to be validated. These scopes are hierarchical and are (from the top down); DataStructure, ConstrainedDataStructure, Dataflow, and ProvisionAgreement. the hierarchy of these scopes represent the cascading level of constraints, which can restrict the valid values for components. For example, a data structure defines a dimension with a coded representation. A data flow might have a constraint associated with it which further restricts the values allowed from the referenced code list to a subset of the values allowed by the data structure definition. A provision agreement that is based on the dataflow might also have a constraint, which further restricts the subset of the codelist from the dataflow. Therefore, the allowed content becomes stricter lower in the hierarchy. Data that is given a scope of one value is stated to be valid at that level and all levels below it. Therefore, this scope serves to state that data that is meant to be structured simply against the data structure definition is not meant to be validated against the a dataflow, where constraints might be applied.
REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY xs:gMonthDay                      The REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY attribute is an explict attribute for the reporting year start day, which provides context to the time dimension when its value contains a reporting period (e.g. 2010-Q1). This attribute is used to state the month and day that the reporting year begins (e.g. --07-01 for July 1st). In the absence of an explicit value provided in this attribute, all reporting period values will be assumed to be based on a reporting year start day of January 1. This is declared in the base schema since it has a fixed identifier and representation. The derived data set type may either require or prohibit this attribute, depending on whether the data structure declared the reporting year start day attribute and if so, the attribute relationship and assignment status assigned to it.

ObjectReference             *com:ReferenceType*                     ObjectReference provides a reference to an identifiable object in the SDMX information model. An identifiable object target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value. This element is unqualified so that the metadata structure definition specific schema can refine the type of the element such that the type of reference is valid according to the object type specified in the identifiable object target in the metadata structure definition. At the very least, the reference will be specific to the type of object being referenced so that a complete set of reference fields must be provided. In cases where an item object is restricted to be from a particular scheme, this type will be further restricted so that only a valid item reference can be supplied. The structure of this reference is such that it can be generically processed without needing to know what the intended target object type is prior to processing, as this information is part of the reference.
DataKey                     com:DataKeyType                         ObjectReference provides a set of dimension references and values for those dimension for the purpose of reporting metadata against a set of data. A key descriptor values target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value. It is not expect that the metadata structure definition specific schema would refine this, but none the less, it is an unqualified element.
DataSetReference            com:SetReferenceType                    DataSetReference provides a reference to a data set for the purpose of reporting metadata against the data. A data set target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value.
ConstraintContentRef erence com: AttachmentConstraint ReferenceType ConstraintContentReference provides a reference to an attachment constraint for the purpose of reporting metadata against the data identified in the key sets and/or cube regions identified by the constraint. A constraint target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value.
ReportPeriod                com: ObservationalTimePer iodType       ReportPeriod provides a report period for the purpose of qualifying the target reporting period of reported metadata. A report period target will utilize this option as the representation of the target reference value. It is not expect that the metadata structure definition specific schema would refine this, but none the less, it is an unqualified element. This element is unqualified so that the metadata structure definition specific schema can refine the type of the element such that the specific type of time value prescribed in the metadata structure definition can be validated.

**ReportedAttributeType: **\ ReportedAttributeType is an abstract base
type that forms the basis for a metadata structure specific metadata
attribute. A value for the attribute can be supplied as either a single
value, or multi-lingual text values (either structured or unstructured).
An optional set of child metadata attributes is also available if the
metadata attribute definition defines nested metadata attributes. The
metadata structure definition specific schema will refine this type for
each metadata attribute such that the content can be validation against
what is defined in the metadata structure definition.

isMetadataAttribute (fixed: true) xs:boolean       The isMetadataAttribute attribute is a fixed boolean (true) and is intended to designate to processing applications that a given element represents a reported attribute. This attribute is qualified (meaning that it will be qualified in an instance with the target namespace) to ensure that it can be properly identified by applications. The purpose of this is to allow applications to identify elements with unknown names as reported attributes so that they may process a metadata structure definition specific instance without knowledge of the underlying metadata structure definition.

Mapping to Structure-Specific Schemas
=====================================

General 
--------

Data structure and metadata structure-specific schemas are each based on
one single core construct found in their respective structure-specific
namespaces;

Data -
http://www.SDMX.org/resources/SDMXML/schemas/v2_1/data/structurespecific

Metadata -
http://www.SDMX.org/resources/SDMXML/schemas/v2_1/data/structurespecific

For a metadata structure, only a single schema will be created for the
entire structure definition. For data structures, many variations of the
base schema are possible, each specific as to how the data is organised.
This will be discussed in more details in the specific rules for the
data structure schemas.

Basic Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the subsequent sections, the following namespace prefixes are used:

============================================================================= ==========
**Namespace**                                                                 **Prefix**
============================================================================= ==========

http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/ v2_1/data/structurespecific     dsd
http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/ v2_1/metadata/structurespecific msd
============================================================================= ==========

It is assumed that in order to use this guide, the reader is familiar
with schema terminology. However, for convenience the following is list
of the terminology used here:

**Schema:** Refers to the format specific schema in general, and in
particular the root xs:schema element of that schema file.

**Global Element:** Refers to an element definition at the top level of
the schema (i.e. an xs:element element in the root xs:schema element).
It will define a name and type (name and type attributes) and possibly a
substitution group (substitutionGroup attribute).

**Local Element:** Refers to an element definition within a complex type
(i.e. an xs:element element contained within a xs:sequence element that
is contained in a xs:complexType element). A local element must define a
name and type (name and type attributes) and may also specify a minimum
and maximum occurrence (minOccurs and maxOccurs attribute).

**Qualified/Unqualified Element:** A qualified element is an element
that must be referred to by the namespace in which it was defined. An
unqualified element does not have a namespace associated with it. The
structure specific schemas make use of unqualified elements to that the
structure specific schemas can restrict the base content to meet the
specific needs of the structure, while maintaining as much of the
original document structure as possible.

**Element Reference:** Refers to an element definition within a complex
type that is a reference to a global element (i.e. an xs:element element
contained within a xs:sequence element that is contained in a
xs:complexType element). An element reference must reference a global
element (via its ref attribute) and may also specify a minimum and
maximum occurrence (minOccurs and maxOccurs attribute).

**Complex Type:** Refers to a complex type definition. In this context,
all complex type definitions occur at the top level of the schema (i.e.
an xs:complexType element in the root xs:schema element). A complex type
must define a name (name attribute) and may be made abstract (via the
abstract attribute’s boolean value).

**Simple Type:** Refers to a simple type definition. In this context,
all simple type definitions occur at the top level of the schema (i.e.
an xs:simpleType element in the root xs:schema element). In this
context, a simple type will always be defined via a restriction (an
xs:restriction element in the xs:simpleType element). The restriction
will reference a base type.

**Anonymous Type:** A complex or simple type definition which occurs
within an element definition. The method is sometimes referred to a the
"Russian-doll" technique as it creates nested constructs. Anonymous
types are not given names and cannot be abstract. The can however, be
derived from other types.

**Content Group:** A group which defines a content model for reuse. This
is contained in the xs:group element, and is defined at the root of the
schema. It allows for a common sequence or choice of elements to be
reused across multiple types without having to redefine the sequence or
choice in each type.

**Uniqueness Constraint:** A uniqueness constraint is defined within an
element and is used to force descendent elements to be unique based on
some criteria of it fields (elements or attributes). This is defined in
an <xs:unique> element, and has content of an <xs:selector> and multiple
<xs:field> elements. The selector designates the descendants that must
be unique (with an xpath attribute) and the field specifies which
property of the selected element must be unique (also with an xpath
attribute)

**Extension:** Refers to the definition of a complex type that is an
extension of another complex type. The extension will always make a
reference to a base. In the schema, this is defined within the
xs:complexType element as a child xs:complexContent element containing
an xs:extension element (with a base attribute).

**Restriction:** Refers to the definition of a simple or complex type
that is a restriction of another type of the same variety. The
restriction will always make a reference to a base. In the schema, this
is defined with an xs:restriction element (with a base attribute).

**Sequence:** Refers to a sequence of elements that may be defined as
the root of a complex type content model, or as part of the content of a
choice or another sequence. This is defined as an xs:sequence element.
The sequence may specify a minimum and maximum occurrence (minOccurs and
maxOccurs attribute).

**Choice:** Refers to a choice of elements that may be defined as the
root of a complex type content model, or as part of the content of a
sequence or another choice. This is defined as an xs:choice element. The
sequence may specify a minimum and maximum occurrence (minOccurs and
maxOccurs attribute).

**Facet:** Refers to a single detail of a simple type restriction. This
is represented by elements such as xs:minInclusive, xs:totalDigits,
xs:minLength, and is contained in the xs:restriction element of a simple
type definition. The value of the facet is contained in a value
attribute of the particular element.

**Enumeration:** Refers to an enumerated value of a simple type
definition. It is represented by an xs:enumeration element contained
within an xs:restriction element of a simple type definition. An
enumeration defines a value (in the value attribute) and documentation
(in xs:documentation elements contained in an xs:annotation element).

**XML Attribute:** Refers to the definition of an XML attribute for a
complex type (i.e. and xs:attribute element in a xs:complexType
element). An attribute must define a name and type (name and type
attributes) and may also specify a usage (use attribute).

Namespace Rules
---------------

Each format specific schema will specify its namespace in the target
namespace of the schema (the targetNamespace attribute of the schema).
This document also assumes that the root namespace (that which is
defined by the xmlns attribute) of the schema will be the same as the
target namespace. Therefore any types or global elements referenced in
these descriptions without a namespace prefix are assumed to be in the
format specific namespace.

The format specific schemas will incorporate the core format namespace
and the common namespace by importing the schemas (via the xs:import
element). If necessary, additional namespaces may be imported and
referenced.

For the purpose of the descriptions here, the default element form for
the schema (as specified in the elementFormDefault attribute of the
schema) is “qualified", and the default attribute form (as specified in
the attributeFormDefault attribute of the schema) is "unqualified".

General Rules
-------------

The following section details the general rules which apply to all
structure specific schema creation.

Component Name Determination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When required to create an XML element or attribute, the name for a
component is always its identifier. However, the identifier may be
inherited. Therefore, the general rules is as follows:

1. If the component defines an identifier, the element or attribute name
   is the value of that identifier

2. Otherwise, the element or attribute name is the identifier of the
   concept from which it takes its semantic (Note that this is
   technically the component identifer).

Representation Determination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every component has a representation associated with it, whether it is
defined as a local representation in the component definition, or it is
inherited from the concept from which the component takes it semantic
(as defined in the concept identity of the component).

The representation of a component is determined by the following
precedence:

1. The local representation defined by the component

2. The core representation defined in the concept from which the
   component takes its semantic

3. A default representation of an un-faceted text format with a data
   type of String.

The representation will either define a text format, or an enumeration
with an enumeration format.

A text format consists of a data type and an optional collection of
facets. It is the combination of these which determine the exact nature
of the component representation. An enumeration consists of a reference
to an item scheme, for which an enumerated list of possible values can
be created.

Simple / Primitive Type Determination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any given representation, there exist rules for determining the
simple or primitive type which should be used to validate the value.
There are no specific requirements to how a simple type is named or if
it is referenced or used as an anonymous type. This section simply
serves to state the requirements of the type for a component based on
its `determined representation <#general-rules>`__.

For example, a dimension may inherit its representation for a concept,
and the data type of a representation data type may be a String. The
simplest solution would be to use the xs:string primitive type. However,
an implementer may have chosen to generate simple types for all concepts
to avoid having to look up the concept core representation for very
component. In this case, the type may be given a name based on the
concept and be a simple derivation from the xs:string type that places
no further restrictions. The result would be that the type that is
actually used for the dimension, although named after the concept, is
effectively the required xs:string. These rules are meant to allow such
flexibility in how types are created. The only requirement is that the
type meet the requirements stated here.

Representation with Enumeration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A representation which defines an enumeration will result in a simple
type that is a restriction of the common:IDType. The simple type will
define enumerations for each item in the item scheme. The value for
these enumerations will be identifier of the item. If desired, the names
of the item may be placed in the documentation of the enumeration, but
this is not required. Example:

<xs:simpleType name="ESTAT.CL_COUNTRY.1.0">

   <xs:restriction base="common:IDType">

   <xs:enumeration value="BE">

   <xs:annotation>

   <xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Belgium</xs:documentation>

   </xs:annotation>

   </xs:enumeration>

Representation with Text Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A representation which defines a text format will result in a simple
type or primitive type. The first step is to determine the base type
from the text format data type:

============================= ==================================
**SDMX Data Type**            **XML Schema Data Type**
============================= ==================================

IdentifiableReference         N/A\ :sup:`1`
DataSetReference              N/A\ :sup:`1`
AttachmentConstraintReference N/A\ :sup:`1`
============================= ==================================

If the text format does not specify any further facets, then the
determined type is the listed type or a type which derives from the
listed type without placing any addition restrictions on it. However, if
one or more facets are specified, then a simple type based on the listed
type is necessary. The simple type derives via restriction from the
listed type and adds facets according to the following table (the values
are mapped as is):

================== ===============================================================
**SDMX Facet**     **XML Schema Facet**
================== ===============================================================
minLength          xs:minLength
maxLength          xs:maxLength
minValue [2]_      if ExclusiveValueRange: xs:minExclusives, else: xs:minInclusive
maxValue\ :sup:`2` if ExclusiveValueRange: xs:maxExclusives, else: xs:maxInclusive
decimals\ :sup:`2` xs:fractionDigits
pattern            xs:pattern
================== ===============================================================

Any other facets are informational only, and will not affect the
determined type.

**Type Names**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These rules will only dictate type names where absolutely necessary. In
all other cases, it is the decision of the implementer as to how to name
or use the type. It is also the implementer's requirement to ensure that
any type name is properly unique within its scope. To assist in this,
the following recommendations are offered for naming types such that
they are unique.

-  It the type is an enumeration from an item scheme, the recommended
   name is [Item Scheme Class].[Maintenance Agency].[Item Scheme
   ID].[Item Scheme Version]

-  If the type is based on a text format of a concept core
   representation, the recommended name is Concept.[Maintenance
   Agency].[Concept Scheme ID].[Concept Scheme Version].[Concept ID]

-  If the type is based on a text format of a component local
   representation, and;

   -  The component id is required to be unique for all components
      within the scope of the structure which defines it (e.g. a
      dimension), the recommended name is [Component ID]

   -  The component id is only required to be unique within the
      component list and which defines it (e.g. a metadata attribute),
      the recommend name is [Component List ID].[Parent Component
      ID]*.[Component ID]

Type Reuse
~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible that organisations that manage a large number of
structure specific schemas my wish to take advantage of the reuse of
previously defined type in order to simply the structure specific schema
creation and lessen the number of schema elements which are created. The
structure specific formats are designed in such a way that this would be
allowed without any adverse affects.

For example, an organisation my create predefined types for all of
codelists and concept schemes which their structures utilize. These
could be contained in a common schema with any namespace deemed
appropriate. This would allow the structure specific schemas generation
process to recognize the reused components and not be concerned with
regenerating types. The logical flow for setting the representation of a
component might be as follows:

   Does the component define a local type?

   Yes: Is that type enumerated?

   Yes: Type is the qualified type name for the item scheme

   No: Generate simple type for text format

   No: Type is the qualified name for the concept from which the
   component takes its semantic.

Only the constructs that will be detailed in the data and metadata
structure-specific rules below are required to be in the specified
target namespace of the structure-specific schema. So long as any other
generated type conforms to the rules specified, it may exist in any
namespace.

Data Structure Specific Schema
------------------------------

Separate schemas will be created for the data structure depending on
which dimension occurs at the observation level, and whether explicit
measures are used in the case that the observation dimension is the
measure dimension. The recommended target namespace of the data
structured specific schema is: [Data Structure
URN]:ObsLevelDim:[Observation Dimensions](:explicit)?. Note that the
explicit trailer is only used when the measure dimension is used at the
observation level and the explicit measure concepts are to be used.

The rules for generating the data structure specific-schema are broken
into sections based on the level within the structure (i.e. data set,
group, series, observation). Each section will state the rules for each
variation of the structure specific format.

DataSetType
~~~~~~~~~~~

A complex type named DataSetType must be created. Its content model will
be derived via restriction. If the dimension at the observation level is
the time dimension (TIME_PERIOD) the base type of the restriction is
dsd:TimeSeriesDataSetType. Otherwise, the base type of the restriction
is dsd:DataSetType. The complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

   b. A local element named DataProvider with the type
      common:DataProviderReferenceType, a form of unqualified and a
      minimum occurrence of 0

   c. If the data structure defines groups, a local element named Group
      with a form of unqualified, a minimum occurrence of 0, and a
      maximum occurrence of unbounded. The type of this element should
      be the type that is described in the GroupType section which
      follows.

   d. A choice with a minimum occurrence of 0 consisting of:

      i.  If the dimension at the observation level is not
          AllDimensions, a local element named Series with a form of
          unqualified, a maximum occurrence of unbounded, and a type of
          SeriesType (as defined in the SeriesType section which
          follows)

      ii. If the dimension at the observation level is AllDimensions, a
          local element named Obs with a form of unqualified, a maximum
          occurrence of unbounded, and a type of ObsType (as defined in
          the ObsType section which follows)

2. If the reporting year start day attribute is not declared in the data
   structure definition or if it is declared but does not declare an
   attribute relationship of None, an attribute named
   REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY with a type of xs:gMonthDay and a usage of
   prohibited

3. An attribute for each attribute defined in the data structured
   definition that declares an attribute relationship of None. The XML
   attribute `name <#component-name-determination>`__ and
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ are defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage
   is optional

GroupType
~~~~~~~~~

If the data structure definition defines only one group, a complex type
with its name taken from the identifier of the lone group must be
defined. This type is used for the Group element in the DataSetType. Its
content model will be derived via restriction of the dsd:GroupType. The
complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

2. An attribute for each dimension referenced by the group. The XML
   attribute `name <#component-name-determination>`__ and
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ are defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage
   is required

3. If the reporting year start day attribute is not declared in the data
   structure definition or if it is declared but does not declare an
   attribute relationship with the group and does not specify the group
   as an attachment group, an attribute named REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY
   with a type of xs:gMonthDay and a usage of prohibited

4. An attribute for each attribute defined in the data structure that
   declares an attribute relationship with the group or specifies the
   group as an attachment group. The XML attribute
   `name <#component-name-determination>`__ and
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ are defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage
   is optional

5. An attribute named type with a type of common:IDType, usage of
   optional, and a fixed value of the identifier of the group

If the data structure definitions defines more than one group, an
abstract complex type with name GroupType must be created. This type is
used for the Group element in the DataSetType. Its content model will be
derived via restriction of the dsd:GroupType. The complex type content
model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

2. An attribute named type with a type of Group.ID, and a usage of
   optional

3. An anyAttribute declaration with a namespace of ##local

A simple type named Group.ID must be created. This should restrict the
common:IDType. For each group defined by the data structure definition,
an enumeration will be created within the restriction with a value of
the group identifier.

For each group defined in the data structure definition, a complex type
with its name taken from the group identifier is defined. Its content
model will be derived via restriction of the previously defined
GroupType. The complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

2. An attribute for each dimension referenced by the group. The XML
   attribute `name <#component-name-determination>`__ and
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ are defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage
   is required

3. If the reporting year start day attribute is not declared in the data
   structure definition or if it is declared but does not declare an
   attribute relationship with the group and does not specify the group
   as an attachment group, an attribute named REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY
   with a type of xs:gMonthDay and a usage of prohibited

4. An attribute for each attribute defined in the data structure that
   declares an attribute relationship with the group or specifies the
   group as an attachment group. The XML attribute

   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ are defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage
   is optional

5. An attribute named type with a type of Group.ID, usage of optional,
   and a fixed value of the identifier of the group

SeriesType
~~~~~~~~~~

If the dimension at the observation is not AllDimensions, a complex type
name SeriesType must be created. Its content model will be derived via
restriction. If the dimension at the observation level is the time
dimension (TIME_PERIOD) the base type of the restriction is
dsd:TimeSeriesType. Otherwise, the base type of the restriction is
dsd:SeriesType. The complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

   b. A local element named Obs with a form of unqualified, a minimum
      occurrence of 0, a maximum occurrence of unbounded, and a type of
      ObsType (as defined in the ObsType section which follows)

2. An attribute for each dimension defined by the data structure
   definition, except for the dimension at the observation level. The
   XML attribute `name <#component-name-determination>`__ and
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ are defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage
   is required

3. If the reporting year start day attribute is not declared in the data
   structure definition or if it is declared and declares an attribute
   relationship of None, or with a group, or the dimension at the
   observation level, or specifies a group as an attachment group, an
   attribute named REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY with a type of xs:gMonthDay
   and a usage of prohibited

4. An attribute for each attribute defined in the data structure that
   declares an attribute relationship with any dimension outside of the
   dimension at the observation level (so long as it does not also
   declare an attachment group). The XML attribute
   `name <#component-name-determination>`__ and
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ are defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage
   is optional

ObsType
~~~~~~~

A complex type name ObsType must be created. Its content model will be
derived via restriction. If the dimension at the observation level is
the time dimension (TIME_PERIOD) the base type of the restriction is
dsd:TimeSeriesObsType. Otherwise, the base type of the restriction is
dsd:ObsType. If the explicit measure option is used, this complex type
must be abstract. The complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

2. If the dimension at the observation level is not the time dimension
   (TIME_PERIOD) an attribute named TIME_PERIOD with a type of
   common:TimePeriodType and a usage of prohibited

3. If the dimension at the observation level is not the time dimension

   level. The XML attribute `name <#component-name-determination>`__ and
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ are defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage
   is required

4. An attribute for the primary measure (OBS_VALUE) defined by the data
   structure definition. The XML attribute
   `name <#component-name-determination>`__ and
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ is defined according

   is optional

5. An attribute for each attribute defined in the data structure that
   declares an attribute relationship with the dimension at the
   observation level or the primary measure (OBS_VALUE). The XML
   attribute `name <#component-name-determination>`__ and
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ are defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage
   is optional

6. An attribute named type. If the explicit measure option is not used,
   this attribute must have a type of common:IDType and a usage of
   prohibited. If the explicit measure option is used, this attribute
   must have a type of the simple type generated for the representation
   of the measure dimension that is the dimension at the observation
   level (this will be an simple type with enumerations with values of
   the concept identifiers which make up the concept scheme that is the
   representation of the measure dimension) a and a usage of optional

If the explicit measure option is used, then complex type must be
created for every concept which make up the representation of the
measure dimension which is the dimension at the observation level. The
name of this complex type will be taken from the identifier of the
concept. Its content model will be derived via restriction of the
ObsType. The complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

2. If the core representation of the Concept differs from that of the
   primary measure, an attribute for the primary measure (OBS_VALUE)
   defined by the data structure definition, except for the dimension at
   the observation level. The XML
   `name <#component-name-determination>`__ is defined according to the
   general rules defined in the previous section, and the usage is
   optional. The type of the attribute is the type that is generated for
   the core representation of the measure concept. Note that this
   representation type must have an explicit derivation from the type
   resulting from the primary measure. For example, if the primary
   measure type is xyz:CodeType, then the simple type which is defined
   for the core representation of the concept must restrict xyz:CodeType
   or one another type which restricts it

3. An attribute named type with a type of the simple type generated for
   the representation of the measure dimension that is the dimension at
   the observation level, a usage of optional, and a fixed value of the
   concept identifier.

Metadata Structure Specific Schema
----------------------------------

One schema will be created for each metadata structure. This schema will
define the contents of all report structures defined by the metadata
structure. The recommended target namespace of the data structured
specific schema is the URN of the metadata structure.

The rules for generating the data structure specific-schema are broken
into sections based on the level within the structure (i.e. metadata
set, metadata targets, reports, metadata attributes). These rules will
recommend names for generated types, and will refer back to these names
throughout the description. These names are simply recommendations that
should produce a unique name, but there is no requirement to use them.
When a name is required, it will be made clear this is the case.

MetadataSetType
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A complex type that must be named MetadataSetType must be created. Its
content model will be derived via restriction of the base type,
msd:MetadataSetType. The complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

   b. An element reference to common:Name, with a minimum occurrence of
      0 and a maximum occurrence of unbounded

   c. A local element named DataProvider with the type
      common:DataProviderReferenceType, a form of unqualified and a
      minimum occurrence of 0

   d. A local element named Report with a type ReportType, a form of
      unqualified, a minimum occurrence of 0, and a maximum occurrence
      of unbounded.

TargetType
~~~~~~~~~~

An abstract complex type with a recommended name of TargetType must be
created. Its content model will be derived via restriction of the
msd:TargetType. The complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. A local element named ReferenceValue with a type of
      msd:ReferenceValueType, a form of unqualified, and a maximum
      occurrence of unbounded

2. An attribute named id with a type of Target.ID, and a usage of
   optional

A simple type with a recommended name of Target.ID must be created. This
should restrict the common:IDType. For each report structure defined by
the metadata structure definition, an enumeration will be created within
the restriction with a value of the report structure identifier.

A simple type with a recommended name of [metadata target
identifier].TargetObject.ID must be created. This should restrict the
Target.ID type. For each target object defined by the metadata target,
an enumeration will be created within the restriction with a value of
the target object identifier.

An abstract complex type with a recommended name of [metadata target
identifier].ReferenceValueType will be created. Its content model will
be derived via restriction of the msd:ReferenceValueType. The complex
type content model will be as follows:

1. A choice consisting of:

   a. A local element named ObjectReference with a type of
      common:ReferenceType, and a form of unqualified

   b. A local element named DataKey with a type of common:DataKeyType,
      and a form of unqualified

   c. A local element named DataSetReference with a type of
      common:SetReferenceType, and a form of unqualified

   d. A local element named ReportPeriod with a type of
      common:ObservationalTimePeriodType, and a form of unqualified

2. An attribute named id with the type defined previously as [metadata
   target identifier].TargetObject.ID, and a usage of optional

For each metadata target defined in the metadata structure definition, a
content group with a recommended name of [metadata target identifier]
with be defined. Its content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. A local element named ReferenceValue with the type previously
      defined as [metadata target identifier].ReferenceValueType, a form
      of unqualified, and a minimum and maximum occurrence of the number
      of target objects defined within the metadata target

For each target object defined by the metadata target, a complex type
that must be named [metadata target identifier].[target object
identifier] must be created. Its content model will be derived via
restriction of the type previously created as [metadata target
identifier].ReferenceValueType type created prior to this. The complex
type content model will be as follows:

1. A choice consisting of:

   a. If the target object is an identifiable object target, a local
      element named ObjectReference with a type determined as defined in
      Identifiable Object Target Type Determination:

   b. If the target object is an key descriptor values target, a local
      element named DataKey with a type of common:DataKeyType, and a
      form of unqualified

   c. If the target object is a data set target, a local element named
      DataSetReference with a type of common:SetReferenceType, and a
      form of unqualified

   d. If the target object is a constraint target, a local element named
      ConstraintReference with a type of
      common:AttachmentConstraintReferenceType, and a form of
      unqualified

   e. If the target object is report period target, a local element
      named ReportPeriod with a form of unqualified, and a
      `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ as defined based
      on the data type of the local representation according to the
      general rules defined in the previous section

2. An attribute named id with a type previously created as [metadata
   target identifier].TargetObject.ID, a usage of optional, and fixed
   value of the target object identifier

The final complex type (which will be the determined type) is derived by
restriction from the reference type determined above. The suggested name
of this type is [metadata target identifier].[target object
identifier].Reference. The content model of this type will be as
follows:

1. A choice consisting of:

   a. A sequence consisting of

      i.  A local element named Ref, with a form of unqualified and a
          the type defined above as is [metadata target].[target
          object].Ref

      ii. A local element named URN, with a form of unqualified, a
          minimum occurrence of 0, and the type defined above as [item
          scheme agency].[item scheme identifier].[item scheme
          version].URN

   b. A local element named URN, with a form of unqualified, and the
      type defined above as [item scheme agency].[item scheme
      identifier].[item scheme version].URN

Identifiable Object Target Type Determination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An identifiable object target is meant to reference an SDMX identifiable
object. In the metadata structure specific schema, the complex type
which defines the reference is restricted according to the local
representation and object type of the identifiable object target. If the
identifiable object target does not provide an enumeration in its local
representation, then the complex type for the target object is the
specific reference type from the common namespace, based on the object
type defined by the target object. For example, if the object type is
DataProivder, the type will be common:DataProviderReferenceType. The
general rule for the name of this type is common:[object
type]ReferenceType.

If the target object defines an enumeration in its local representation,
then the declared object type must be for the items contained the
enumeration's referenced item scheme. If this is not true, the reference
type as defined above is the type for the target object.

If the object type does correspond with the enumeration item scheme,
then the type is complex type which restricts the reference to the
allowable values. In order to construct this type, the following must be
created:

A simple type which enumerates with URNs of the items contained in the
items scheme referenced from the enumeration. The recommended name is
[item scheme agency].[item scheme identifier].[item scheme version].URN.
This simple type should restrict the xs:anyURI type an contain
enumerations with values of the URN of every item defined by the scheme.

A second simple type which enumerates the IDs of the items contained in
the items scheme referenced from the enumeration. The recommended name
is [item scheme agency].[item scheme identifier].[item scheme
version].ID. This simple type should restrict the either the
common:NestedIDType for hierarchical items or the common:IDType for flat
items. The restriction should contain enumerations with values of the ID
of every item defined by the scheme. For hierarchical items (such as
categories), the id should be nested to reflect the full path (e.g.
A.C.D.F).

A complex type which restricts the full set of reference fields for the
item to be reference must be created. The recommended name is [metadata
target].[target object].Ref. This type is derived via restriction of the
type which defines the full set of reference fields for the item
referenced by the target object. For example, if the object type is
Category, the type that is the base of the restriction is
common:CategoryRefType. . The general rule for the name of this type is
common:[object type]RefType. The content model of this type must be as
follows:

1. An attribute named agencyID with a type of common:NestNCNameIDType, a
   use of required, and a fixed value of the item scheme referenced from
   the enumeration

2. An attribute named maintinableParentID with a type of common:IDType,
   a use of required, and a fixed value of the identifier of the item
   scheme referenced from the enumeration

3. An attribute named maintainableParentVersion with a type of
   common:VersionType, a use of optional, and a fixed value of the
   version of the item scheme referenced from the enumeration

4. An attribute named id, with a use of option, and the type defined
   above as [item scheme agency].[item scheme identifier].[item scheme
   version].ID.

ReportType
~~~~~~~~~~

A simple type with a recommend name of Report.ID must be created. This
must restrict the common:IDType. For each report structure defined by
the metadata structure definition, an enumeration will be created within
the restriction with a value of the report structure identifier.

An abstract complex type with a recommended name of ReportType must be
created. Its content model will be derived via restriction of the
msd:ReportType. The complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

   b. A local element named Target with the type previously defined as
      TargetType and a form of unqualified

   c. A local element named AttributeSet with no type assigned and a
      form of unqualified

2. An attribute named id with a type previously defined as Report.ID,
   and a usage of optional

For each report structure defined in the metadata structure definition,
a complex type with its name taken from the report structure identifier
must be defined. In order to construct this type, some other complex
type must be defined first.

A simple type with a recommended name of [report structure
identifier].Target.ID must be created. This must restrict the type
previously created as Target.ID. For each metadata target referenced by
the report structure, an enumeration will be created within the
restriction with a value of the metadata target identifier.

An abstract complex type must be create, with a recommended name of
[report structure identifier].TargetType. Its content model will be
derived by restriction of the type previously created as TargetType. The
content model of this type must be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. A local element named ReferenceValue with a type of
      msd:ReferenceValueType, a form of unqualified, and a maximum
      occurrence of unbounded

2. An attribute named id with the type previously created as [report
   structure identifier].Target.ID, and a use of optional

For each metadata target referenced from the report structure, a complex
type that must be named [report structure identifier].[metadata target
identifier] must be created. This type must derived its content by
restriction of the type previously defined as [report structure
identifier].TargetType. The content model is as follows:

1. A reference to the content group that was previously created as
   [metadata target identifier] for this metadata target

2. An attribute named id with the type create previously as [report
   structure identifier].Target.ID, a use of optional, and a fixed value
   of [metadata target identifier]

For every metadata attribute defined by the report structure a complex
type must be created with the recommended name of [report structure
identifier].[nested metadata attribute identifier]. Note that the
recommend name assumes the metadata attribute identifier is the nested
identifier for the full hierarchy in which the metadata attribute was
defined. This content model of this type is derived from restriction of
the msd:ReportedAttributeType. The content of this must consists be as
follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

   b. If the isPresentational flag is not set to true:

      i.  If the `determined representation <#general-rules>`__ has data
          type of XHTML, an element reference to common:StructuredText
          with a maximum occurrence of unbounded

      ii. If the `determined representation <#general-rules>`__ has is
          not XHTML, but has a facet of isMultiLinguale, an element
          reference to common: Text with a maximum occurrence of
          unbounded

   c. If the metadata attribute defines which child metadata attributes,
      a local element named AttributeSet with a form of unqualified, and
      a type as defined according to the rules defined in Attribute Set
      Complex Type Creation

2. An attribute named id with a type of common:IDType, a use of
   optional, and a fixed value of [metadata attribute identifier], where
   this identifier is not nested

3. If the isPresentational flag is not set to true, and the `determined
   representation <#general-rules>`__ is not XHTML and does not have a
   facet of isMultiLingual, an attribute named value where the
   `type <#simple-primitive-type-determination>`__ is defined according
   to the general rules defined in the previous section, and the use is
   required

For each report structure defined in the metadata structure, a complex
type that must be named [report structure identifier] must be created.
Its content model will be derived via restriction of the previously
defined ReportType. The complex type content model will be as follows:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. An element reference to common:Annotations, with a minimum
      occurrence of 0

   b. A local element named Target with the type previously defined as
      [report structure identifier].TargetType, and a form of
      unqualified. This element must define a uniqueness constraint with
      a recommended name of [report structure
      identifier].Target.ReferenceValue.Unique. This uniqueness
      constraint must contain:

      i.  A selector with an xpath of "*"

      ii. A field with an xpath of "@id"

   d. A local element named AttributeSet with a form of unqualified and
      a type as defined according to the rules defined in Attribute Set
      Complex Type Creation

2. An attribute named id with the type previously defined as Report.ID,
   a use of optional, and a fixed value of [report structure identifier]

Attribute Set Complex Type Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An attribute set is created for a report structure or a metadata
attribute which contains child metadata attributes. This type is a
complex type with a recommend name of [report structure
identifier].[nested metadata attribute identifier].AttributeSet, where
the metadata attribute section only applies to attribute sets created
for metadata attributes and is assumed to consist of the full hierarchy
of the metadata attribute's definition. This complex type must consists
of:

1. A sequence consisting of:

   a. A local element for each metadata attribute defined as a direct
      child of the object for which the attribute set is being created.
      The recommended name of this element is [metadata attribute
      identifier] and it has a form of unqualified. If the metadata
      attribute defines a minOccurs and maxOccurs, these values are
      translated to this element. The type of this element is the type
      previously created as [report structure identifier].[nested
      metadata attribute identifier].

Special data functions
======================

Updates
-------

Both the generic and the structure-specific data messages allow for
incremental updating of data. This purpose is noted in the action for
the data set, which is either inherited from the header of the data
message or explicitly stated at the data set level.

A dataset with an action of Append is assumed to be an incremental
update. This means that one the information provided explicitly in the
message should be altered. Any data attribute or observation value that
is to be changed must be provided. However, the absence of an
observation value or a data attribute at any level does not imply
deletion; instead it is simply implied that the value is to remain
unchanged. Therefore, it is valid and acceptable to send a data message
with an action of Append which contains only a Series elements with
attribute values. In this case, the values for the attributes will be
updated. Note that it is not permissible to update data attributes using
partial keys (outside of those associated with defined groups). In order
to update an attribute, a full key must always be provided even if the
message format does not require this.

Deletes
-------

Both the generic and the structure-specific data messages allow for
incremental deletion of data. This purpose is noted in the action for
the data set, which is either inherited from the header of the data
message or explicitly stated at the data set level.

A dataset with an action of Delete is assumed to be an incremental
deletion. The deletion is assumed to take place of the lowest level of
detail provided in the message. For example, if a delete message is sent
with only a data set element, the entire data set will be deleted. On
the other hand, if that data set contains a data attribute, only that
data attribute value will be deleted. This same dynamic continues
through the data set hierarchy. A data set containing only a series with
no data attributes or observations will result in that entire series
(all observations and data attributes) being deleted. If the series
contains data attributes, only the supplied data attributes for that
series will be deleted. Finally, if a series contains observations, then
only the specified observations will be deleted. If an entire
observation is to be deleted (value and data attributes), only the
observation dimension should be provided. If only the observation value
or particular data attributes are to be deleted, then these should be
specified for the observation. Note that a group can only be used to
delete the data attributes associated with it. Although the format might
not require it, a full key must be provided to delete a series or
observation. It is not permissible to wild card a key in order to delete
more than one series or observation. Finally, to delete a data attribute
or observation value it is recommended that the value to be deleted be
supplied; however, it is only required that any valid value be provided.
